    [0, [{lat:30.044444, lng:31.23583330}, "Dinar of Al-Amir (12th century, 1951.31.4.234)<br/><br/>This coin was circulated in the Fatimid Caliphate during the 12th century. During this time, the capital of the Fatimid Caliphate was located in Cairo, where the Arabian peninsula meets the African continent. This coin bears an inscription of the first few lines of the Quran, signifying the strongly religious foundation for the rule of the Fatimid dynasty."]],
    [1, [{lat:37.984167, lng:23.728056}, "Tetradrachm of Athens (449-420 BCE, 1.1965.1593)<br/><br/>This coin was circulated throughout the ancient Greek and displays Athena, the patron goddess of Athens. On the reverse is one of Athena's symbols: the owl and the Greek letters A O E. All these clues point to the coin being from Greece; however, interestingly different societies (Palestinians, etc.) would come into contact with the original Tetradrachm of Athens through trade, subsequently recognize the importance and efficiency of money, and adopt the concept of “coins” into their own society and the easiest way to do so was to replicate the original coins. Therefore, there are a lot of replicas of the Tetradrachm of Athens which look remarkably similar but are from different areas of the world."]],
    [2, [{lat:48.856667, lng:2.352222}, "Napoleon I and the Arc de Triomphe (1836, 1953.35.6)<br/><br/>This coin was not used as currency, but rather as a medal given by Napoleon to signify his gratitude. This coin highlights the strength of the Roman influence on Napoleon through the use of ivy in Napoleon's hair, the triumphal arch often used to symbolize victory in Roman times, as well as the use of a commemorative coin."]],
    [3, [{lat:32.5425, lng:44.421111}, "Tetradrachm of Alexander III, the Great (319-315 BCE, 2002.34)<br/><br/>This coin depicts Hercules and Zeus holding an eagle, signifying the comparisons between Alexander and Zeus/Hercules. Furthermore, this was a tactic both Greek and Roman emperors used often - depicting Gods on their coins to liken themselves to Gods and cement their own rule.<br/><br/>Furthermore, Alexander the Great instigated monetary reform by creating the Attic weight standard and minting his new coinage by this standard. Previous to the Attic weight standard, 'different issuing authoritied in the Greek world (whether cities, kings of governors) issued coins on different weight standards ... evidence that survives suggests that such exchange incurred a commission fee' (Meadows 174). Alexander's new standardized currency was usable across the cities of the empire without further transaction expenses and inconveniences: it was a 'common currency.'"]],
    [4, [{lat:37.730278, lng:22.7575}, "(Reproduction of) Mask of Agamemnon (original: 1550-1500 BCE, 1901.6)<br/><br/>It is a gold mask depicting a bearded man with eyes that seem simultaneously open and closed. It was made by hammering gold into a thin leaf, making the mask look fragile and almost paper (or skin) like. The reproduction of the Mask of Agamemnon is - as the name suggests - a reproduction of a “death mask” of an Achaean lord from Mycenae. A death mask is a mask which covers the face of someone once they pass; death masks are honors reserved for men with wealth and status - after all, making such an intricate mask out of precious metal is both labor intensive and expensive. In other words, this death mask is a symbol of wealth (money!). Furthermore, this mask invites some interesting questions: why are the eyes both open and closed? Perhaps this mask is meant to be a symbol of wealth in both death and life and thus the mask gives the wearer the impression of being both awake and asleep."]],
    [5, [{lat:40.683333, lng:24.65}, "Half Stater of Thasos (404-340 BCE, 1.1965.1333)<br/><br/>This coin circulated in Thrace, and bears the head of Dionysos wearing a wreath on the obverse and Hercules drawing a bow on the reverse. These were the two patron deities of Thrace and are well-known characters in Greek mythology which provides clues to the coin's origin. Thasos was a great trading post rich in minerals such as gold."]],
    [6, [{lat:41.893333, lng:12.482778}, "Romano-Campanian Didrachm, Rome (269-266 BCE, 1.1965.78)<br/><br/>This coin depicts a man's head on one side, and a wolf caring for two small children on the other. The wolf represents the wolf in Rome’s origin story - the wolf which raised Remus and Romulus (the man who eventually founded Rome). The two small figures are Remus and Romulus. In other words, the wolf serves as propaganda to remind citizens who carry and use this coin of their common origin and inspire pride. This is similar to the reason why American coins have eagles on them and supports the belief that coins can be used as propaganda.<br/><br/>Note that the material of the Romans' coins reflected the health of their empire: during less prosperous times or times of high inflation, the Romans were forced to make coins out of bronze or leftover scrap metal. In more prosperous times, they could make coins out of silver and gold.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the man on the other side is most likely the father or grandfather of the treasurer who minted this coin. In the Roman republic, three treasurers were elected to take care of money, and they would often print the image of one of their older male relatives on the coin to give their only family more fame and power. Specifically, Roman coins were 'generally supposed to be informational or educational: they are to advertise the moneyer to the general populace before his embarkation on a more prominent political career, with the selected audience being the citizens of Rome' (DeRose Evans 19). After all, in a political election, people are probably more likely to vote for someone they see all the time on their coins than to vote for someone they’ve never seen or heard of in their life. In other words, not only can coins be used as propaganda for a country, coins can also be for political reasons."]],
    [7, [{lat:41.013889, lng:28.955556}, "Follis of Justinian I (527-538 CE, 35.2005.19)<br/><br/>This coin pictures Justinian I as well as various religious symbols on the obverse, and an 'M' on the reverse. This was used to indicate the value of the coin, as part of Justinian's efforts to create a standardized currency. Rather than use more precious materials such as gold or silver, Justinian I decided to use bronze coins for everyday currency and this highlights Justinian's efforts in monetary reform.<br/><br/>Furthermore, Justinian is front-facing in this coin. In previous coins we’d seen, the emperor’s profile is shown. Justinian I began the front-facing trend on coins. Aside from being a stylistic choice, Professor Georganteli mentioned this might actually be a part of monetary reform as well: in order to stop circulating old coins, emperor Justinian had to offer his people a better coinage to trade in old coins for, so he adopted the front–facing portrait. Lastly, the crosses above Justianian’s shoulders point to a larger tradition of placing Christian symbols on coins which was a theme we saw in this week’s coins."]],
    [8, [{lat:41.013889, lng:28.955556}, "Coin of Leo III (720-725 CE, 1951.31.4.1072)<br/><br/>This coin depicts Leo III as well as his son Constantine V. This coin marks a departure from the pattern of using an image of Jesus Christ, although there is still religious symbolism through the cross. Furthermore, the inclusion of his son was meant to strengthen the legitimacy of family dynasties. Furthermore, while many Roman coins depicts side-views of individuals, this coin is notable for including front-facing imagery of Leo III and his son - a practice that began in the Byzantine empire: Byzantine coinage moved away from depictions of violence and interestingly, all the depictions of busts are full-frontal facing instead of the side profiles of the Roman coinage. These iconographical changes reflected 'the confidence copper coinage enjoyed in the economy of the empire' (Georganteli 166)."]],
    [9, [{lat:41.013889, lng:28.955556}, "Hyperperon of Andronikos II (1282-1328 CE, 1951.31.4.1913)<br/><br/>This coin depicts the Virgin Mary standing within the walls of Constantinople with hands raised in prayer on the obverse and Andronikos II kneeling at Jesus's feet on the reverse, suggesting a plea that the city of Constantinople, and by extension the Byzantine empire, would hold out against external pressures. Furthermore the coin, while made of gold, is remarkably thin, hinting at the poor economic condition of the Byzantine empire."]],
    [10, [{lat:37.866667, lng:32.483333}, "Dirham of Kay Khusraw II (1235-1237 CE, 52.2003)<br/><br/>This coin depicts a sun and a lion below it, representing the two pillars of society in Shia Islam -- the state and islamic religion. Interestingly, many other coins of this time only depicted writing, indicating that it was not common practice to include imagery. However, this wasn’t a “rule” - merely a widely accepted practice. Thus, Kay Khusraw II technically wasn’t breaking any rules - just going against the norm. Furthermore, it is still possible to discern this coin's origins from the Arabic script on the reverse as was typical of many other Islamic coins."]],
    [11, [{lat:33.549167, lng:68.423333}, "Dirham of Genghis Khan (1206-1227 CE, 2006.237)<br/><br/>This coin only bears the inscriptions 'The Great Genghis Khan' and 'Commander of the Faithful.' The lack of overt symbolism regarding specific religions or individuals may have been part of an attempt to unify the many different subjects under Mongol reign. This is because coins are often used as propaganda: in fact, in some sense, Islamic coins did a better job because unlike images, there’s less room for interpretation in script so rulers were able to send an exact message to the people depending on what they wanted to say. On the other hand, script might have been less pervasive than images because not everyone knew how to read."]],
    [12, [{lat:33.513056, lng:36.291944}, "Dirham of Al-Walid I, Damascus (713 CE, 1951.31.4.2393)<br/><br/>This coin bears text only, following the tradition of omitting any representations of animate objects. Specifically, 'because of their possible use as objects of worship, the production of human or other animate images is censured' (Wasserstein 303)."]],
    [13, [{lat:48.856667, lng:2.352222}, "Assignats (1792, P1982.409.29.1)<br/><br/>This painting depicts the French paper currency ('assignat') used during and following the French revolution. This can be seen from the French writing on the currency.  It wasn’t a coincidence that France began issuing bank notes 'against a background of both monetary and a debt crisis' after 'the French currency lost nearly half of its value in terms of silver' (Bonney 255). France was in poor economic shape during the French Revolution and was forced to issue bank notes to address possible bankruptcy and the bank notes were backed by France-owned properties. These bank notes were essentially a “I Owe You” from France. Although banknotes faced lots of controversy, they began to circulate widely, partly due to their convenience."]],
    [14, [{lat:51.507222, lng:-0.1275}, "This painting was created in 1826 and was created in response to a UK banking crisis. The painting depicts bank notes pinned to birds with the birds promising “I promise to pay!” and people shooting down the birds, saying things such as “No useless rags for me!” This reveals the ugly truth of paper money - it works well during times of peace and economic stability. However, during times of economic crisis, paper money can no longer be backed by gold reserves or land because there aren’t enough gold reserves or land and so paper money essentially becomes an “empty promise” - the government has promised this paper can be exchanged for something valuable, but isn't able to keep this promise. This can cause mass panic (as depicted in the painting) which manifests as bank runs."]],
    [15, [{lat:10.5, lng:-66.916667}, "Cacao Beans (1932, 32-13-30/17)<br/><br/>They are small, brown, flakey and in a roughly oval shape. Cacao beans were initially developed as a crop in South America and were highly valued in the Mayan and Aztec societies. They were essentially used as money by both the Mayans and Aztecs: these beans could pay for food, clothes, gifts, and even taxes or offerings to the gods; in fact the circulation of the cacao bean 'enabled the creation of the extensive trading system upon which the central Valley of Mexico depended' (Richard and Giráldez 57). Aztecs even derived a system in which goods could be quantified by the number of cacao beans it was worth; in other words, pre-Columbian civilizations in the Americas really did use cacao beans like dollars! Cacao beans, like many other forms of wealth we’ve seen (jewelry, cowrie shells, etc.) were also used to set the wealthy apart from the masses since the consumption of the chocolate drink was restricted to Aztec elite, including the royal family or wealthy merchants.<br/><br/>"]],
    [16, [{lat:14.8375, lng:-89.1425}, "Lid of incensario with modelled cacao flower and pods (ca. 700 CE, 95-42-20/C598)<br/><br/>Cacao beans not only had financial significance as a mainstream currency and store of value, but also spiritual significance as they were often an offering to the gods and thought of as the food/drink of the gods. It is the lid of an incensario with four, small representations of cacao pods. Incensarios were incense burners and had important roles in ceremonial and religious affairs in Mayan culture. For example, the Mayans often burned incense to communicate with their gods or ancestors which is why these incensarios were often depicted with important spiritual images or carvings such as images of revered ancestors (such as the ancestors of rulers) or carvings of the gods themselves. Therefore, the fact that this incensario has four small representations of cacao pods on it shows the spirituality of cacao pods and their importance in the Mayan religion."]]
